# AWS WAF Advanced Rules with Terraform

:star: don't forget star us on GitHub, please, it motivates me to keep writing new rules!

[AWS Waf Advanced Rules with Terraform](https://github.com/glaucius/aws-waf-terraform-advanced-rules) is just a place where you can find some awesome and complex rules to AWS WAF, written on top of Terraform, in order to automate your WAF rules to AWS. It is based on a sigle rule group, but I suggest you to split your rules into groups, to allow it to be used as much granularity as possible.
